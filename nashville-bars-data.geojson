If you don’t want to guess, you can get the code by asking them, finding a club member, or checking with a downtown hotel concierge (if you’re traveling).\n\nOnce you have the code, punch it into the bright red vintage phone booth that guards the entrance. Have your camera ready as something really cool happens!\n\nCome in, and enjoy a lively time of cocktails, cigars, and pizza — because what’s illicit booze without a slice?",

This truly is the most hidden watering hole in the city.\n\nTo get to the hidden bar, first get yourself to the boutique hotel’s basement. Look for a nondescript door and double-way mirror, and go through the door which you’d almost certainly never open otherwise.\n\nYou’ll find an Instagram-worthy entryway, and then a themed bar and lounge. Themes vary, but they’re always well executed. Expect the drinks to complement the decor.",

It’s also an easy place to spot — just look for the green window in Germantown.\n\nAnd, you’ll specifically want to stop in when the window is lit up green. Absinthe cocktails are only served if the green lights are on, and they’re the main reason to seek this place out. The other is if you happen to be in Germantown rather than on Broadway.",

To top it off, the place just happens to be in Green Hills.\n\nThis place is worth coming to for lunch even if you aren’t a botanist.

The space features folk art, family photos, and artifacts that create a cozy, eclectic feel.\n\nThe Late Great at Virgin Hotels harkens back to the golden days of country music. You could easily imagine Johnny Cash himself having a cocktail here. The speakeasy is modeled after the rooms music studio “B rooms”, where the musicians could be found lounging but industry executives generally weren’t allowed.\n\nThis is one speakeasy that remains a fairly private club, complete with liquor lockers. You’re able to call ahead for reservations if you have a small group, though. Ask on the phone how to recognize the unmarked door. ",
