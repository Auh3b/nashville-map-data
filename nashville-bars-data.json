[{"name":"red phone booth","description":"Red Phone Booth is a true speakeasy, in that you won\u2019t gain access without a secret code. If you don\u2019t want to guess, you can get the code by asking them, finding a club member, or checking with a downtown hotel concierge (if you\u2019re traveling).\n\nOnce you have the code, punch it into the bright red vintage phone booth that guards the entrance. Have your camera ready as something really cool happens!\n\nCome in, and enjoy a lively time of cocktails, cigars, and pizza \u2014 because what\u2019s illicit booze without a slice?","address":"136 Rosa L. Parks Blvd, Nashville, TN","latitude":36.160115,"longitude":-86.782589,"coordinates":"-86.782589,36.160115"},{"name":"Hidden Bar - Noelle Hotel","description":"There\u2019s no secret entry to the Hidden Bar. You just need to find it at the Noelle Hotel, and that hint is only so much help. This truly is the most hidden watering hole in the city.\n\nTo get to the hidden bar, first get yourself to the boutique hotel\u2019s basement. Look for a nondescript door and double-way mirror, and go through the door which you\u2019d almost certainly never open otherwise.\n\nYou\u2019ll find an Instagram-worthy entryway, and then a themed bar and lounge. Themes vary, but they\u2019re always well executed. Expect the drinks to complement the decor.","address":"200 4th Ave N, Nashville, TN","latitude":36.163975,"longitude":-86.778787,"coordinates":"-86.778787,36.163975"},{"name":"Old Glory","description":"Old Glory is another bar that\u2019s well hidden, albeit not as intentionally as the Hidden Bar. The three-story bar is the boiler room of a former dry cleaner. Head to Villa Place, go along the interior hallway, and descend the stairs downward toward where the boiler room would\u2019ve been.\n\nThere\u2019s no mistaking that this used to be a boiler room, as there are only some small windows up high that let in natural light. The atmosphere is much different now, though. Be sure to note the plants growing along the walls, in between sips of a finely crafted cocktail.","address":"1200 Villa Pl UNIT 103, Nashville, TN 37212","latitude":36.142844,"longitude":-86.791685,"coordinates":"-86.791685,36.142844"},{"name":"Skull's Rainbow Room","description":"Skull\u2019s Rainbow Room isn\u2019t on this list so much because of its secrecy \u2014 the place itself claims to be \u201cworld famous.\u201d Instead, Skull\u2019s is on this list for capturing the high class of speakeasies.\n\nCome here for the fine dining and exquisite drinks, and take in the ambiance. That ambiance will almost certainly include live music or a show of some sort. You might even become a show volunteer if you sit near the pit when the burlesque dancers are on (which is often). You\u2019ve been warned.","address":"225 Printers Alley, Nashville, TN","latitude":36.164026,"longitude":-86.778385,"coordinates":"-86.778385,36.164026"},{"name":"Black Rabbit","description":"Black Rabbit was a true speakeasy, and fairly credibly for the mobster Al Capone. There are supposedly hidden tunnels beneath the speakeasy, which Capone would use to smuggle booze from the Cumberland River to the bars on Printers Alley. Unfortunately, these tunnels remain hidden.\n\nToday, Black Rabbit is a licensed establishment with entirely legal liquors. Come here for a good drink,and take in the history of the place. It was once also the office of Jimmy Hoffa\u2019s attorney.","address":"218 3rd Ave N, Nashville, TN 37201","latitude":36.164938,"longitude":-86.777971,"coordinates":"-86.777971,36.164938"},{"name":"Fox Bar & Cocktail Club","description":"Easiest the best place on this list, what the Fox Bar & Cocktail Club lacks in secrecy it makes up for in quality. Several of the mixologists have won competitions, and they can create almost anything you\u2019ve heard of or could imagine.\n\nKeep your eye out for Gatsby, as this is exactly the type of place he might frequent in The Great Gatsby. Ask him to share a charcuterie board if you do see the fictional character \u2014 the board is award-winning too.","address":"2905B Gallatin Pike, Nashville, TN 37216","latitude":36.202877,"longitude":-86.739424,"coordinates":"-86.739424,36.202877"},{"name":"Green Hour Cocktail & Absinthe Lounge","description":"For an equally swanky, but different, feel head to Green Hour Cocktail & Absinthe Lounge. It\u2019s a French-themed place where you might meet a poet, novelist, or otherwise slightly inebriated dreamer. It\u2019s also an easy place to spot \u2014 just look for the green window in Germantown.\n\nAnd, you\u2019ll specifically want to stop in when the window is lit up green. Absinthe cocktails are only served if the green lights are on, and they\u2019re the main reason to seek this place out. The other is if you happen to be in Germantown rather than on Broadway.","address":"1201 5th Ave N, Nashville, TN 37208","latitude":36.17531,"longitude":-86.788239,"coordinates":"-86.788239,36.17531"},{"name":"Greenhouse Bar","description":"Greenhouse Bar, not to be confused with Green Hour Lounge, is hidden away within a large greenhouse. There\u2019s nothing quite like sipping surrounded by flora from all over. Who knows, perhaps the mint in your mint julep came from just outside the door. To top it off, the place just happens to be in Green Hills.\n\nThis place is worth coming to for lunch even if you aren\u2019t a botanist. Cocktails are paired with craft beers, and the kitchen puts out some decent sandwiches and snacks. It\u2019s also a much more laid-back feel than the nightly seen downtown.","address":"2211 Bandywood Dr, Nashville, TN 37215","latitude":36.10443,"longitude":-86.81761,"coordinates":"-86.81761,36.10443"},{"name":"Dirty Little Secret","description":"The Dirty Little Secret is that this place is little-known outside of Nashville locals. Near Printers Alley, where almost everyone heads, this hole in the wall gets overlooked because of its location and appearance. Look for a nondescript bar just off of Printers Alley, rather than a ritzy one right on the street.\n\nBeing a local gem doesn\u2019t mean The Dirty Little Secret is cheap. It\u2019s where locals head for a special night out. Cocktails regularly run $10+.Seats can fill up on busier evenings, too. It\u2019ll just be a more Nashville crowd than what\u2019s at the others.","address":"210 Printers Alley, Nashville, TN 37201","latitude":36.16433,"longitude":-86.77866,"coordinates":"-86.77866,36.16433"},{"name":"The Late Great Nashville","description":"The Late Great is one of many bars in midtown Nashville, located below the Virgin Hotel with its interior designed by Hannah Crowell, granddaughter of Johnny Cash, and it pays homage to country music and Americana icons from the 1970s and earlier. The space features folk art, family photos, and artifacts that create a cozy, eclectic feel.\n\nThe Late Great at Virgin Hotels harkens back to the golden days of country music. You could easily imagine Johnny Cash himself having a cocktail here. The speakeasy is modeled after the rooms music studio \u201cB rooms\u201d, where the musicians could be found lounging but industry executives generally weren\u2019t allowed.\n\nThis is one speakeasy that remains a fairly private club, complete with liquor lockers. You\u2019re able to call ahead for reservations if you have a small group, though. Ask on the phone how to recognize the unmarked door.
